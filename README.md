# ResumeHackers


Problem Domain: The puroose of the app is to facilitate the generation of stuent resumes into the Code Fellow standard resume template. Code Fellows requires a standard resume templete as a result of feedback from partner companies.

Prior to this app, students were reuqired to manually format and submit their resumes. Many times the Code Fellows staff had to retype the resumes into the standard template.

This app provides users fields into which they can enter their resume information (personal details, employment history, eductation, etc). The app will format the resume into the Code Fellows standard and allow users the ability to save as a PDF or print.
